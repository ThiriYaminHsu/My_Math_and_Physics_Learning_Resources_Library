Theoretical-Physics-SelfStudy
This repository documents my self-study journey in Theoretical Physics, guided by the insights shared by Nobel Laureate Gerard 't Hooft. The guidelines outlined by Professor 't Hooft, particularly in his resource How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist, have been a cornerstone of my learning experience. In addition to serving as a record of my exploration into theoretical physics, this repository also hosts my study notes on various topics.
