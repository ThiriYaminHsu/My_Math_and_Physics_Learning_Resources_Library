# Theoretical-Physics-Self-Study

This repository documents my self-study in Theoretical Physics, guided by the Nobel Laureate Gerard 't Hooft and the graduate-level courses from the Perimeter Institute. 

### Graduate-level Theoretical Physics courses from the Perimeter Institute
- [Statistical Physics](https://psi-online.perimeterinstitute.ca/courses/take/statistical-physics)
- [Quantum Field Theory I](https://psi-online.perimeterinstitute.ca/courses/take/quantum-field-theory-i-student)

### PRIMARY MATHEMATICS
- Dave E. Joyce's trigonometry course
- Beginning Algebra (West Texas A&M)

### CLASSICAL MECHANICS
- Static mechanics (forces, tension); hydrostatics. Newton's Laws.
- The elliptical orbits of planets. The many-body system.
- The action principle. Hamilton's equations. The Lagrangean. (Don't skip - extremely important!)
- The harmonic oscillator. The pendulum.
- Poisson's brackets.
- Wave equations. Liquids and gases. The Navier-Stokes equations. Viscosity and friction
- An intermediate level course on Analytical Classical Dynamics by R. Fitzpatrick, Univ. of Texas, Austin.
